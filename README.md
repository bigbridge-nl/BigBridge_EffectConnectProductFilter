# BigBridge EffectConnectProductFilter
This little extension is used to filter the product collection used by the EffectConnect_Plus extension created by Koek&Peer. Normally the extension loads all products from a store view, but we filter them on a newly created product attribute called 'effectconnect_allow_export'.
